# rust-embedded-community

The [rust-embedded-community](https://github.com/rust-embedded-community) Github organization is simply a place for [Rust language](https://www.rust-lang.org) crates in need of a good home.

## The idea

Several members of the Rust Embedded Working Group got together at Oxidize 2019 and wondered, what can we do with these half-finished projects we've started but never quite find the time to finish? Rather than invite each other to all our repositories, we wondered if there could be a place where unloved crates could move in and get some of the care and attention they deserve. And so, the rust-embedded-community was born.

## Joining the community

We need maintainers! If you're interested in updating some of the projects we care for, open an issue on this `meta` repo, or submit a PR on this README adding yourself to the Maintainers section.

## Projects

We currently look after:

* console-traits - a crate for handling text-based consoles on `no_std` embedded systems. If you implement this trait on the serial port in your project, you'll get rudimentary ANSI support for any text you print to the screen.

## Maintainers
